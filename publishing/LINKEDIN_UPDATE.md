Add this section after the "What's next" or closing paragraph:

> **The models are live.**
>
> All four CMMC Expert models are available for free download — no API keys, no cloud dependency, no sign-up:
>
> Hugging Face: huggingface.co/Nathan-Maine
> Ollama: `ollama pull Nathan-Maine/cmmc-expert-7b` (also 14b, 32b, 72b)
> GitHub: github.com/NathanMaine/cmmc-compliance-ai-model
>
> Pick the size that fits your hardware. The 7B runs on a laptop. The 72B runs on a workstation. Same compliance knowledge, same 8 frameworks, different depth.

> Every model covers CMMC 2.0, NIST 800-171, 800-53, 800-172, 800-37, HIPAA, DFARS (7012/7019/7020/7021), and the NIST CSF. Runs fully local — no internet, no API fees, no CUI exposure.

> Apache 2.0 licensed. Use them however you want.

> If you're working on CMMC certification, I'd genuinely appreciate hearing if these are useful. The whole point was to build something that solves the actual bottleneck.
